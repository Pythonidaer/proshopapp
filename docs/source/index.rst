Welcome to ProShopApp's documentation!
===================================

**ProShopApp** is a *MERN* tutorial project. I followed this 
Udemy course created by Brad Traversy to learn 
more about React and other technologies.
The main website can be found  `here. <https://proshopapp2023.herokuapp.com/>`_

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
