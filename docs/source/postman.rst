What is Postman?!?
------------------

Postman is an API tool or an HTTP client that is used to test out backend *endpoints* or backend *routes* before we integrate them into our frontend, into React and into our Redux *state flow*.

Basically it helps the CRUD+ requests be tested before you write the code that the users will be interacting with.
